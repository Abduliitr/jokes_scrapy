# jokes_scrapy

## You must have scrapy installed!

demo_project is the main folder.
The rest 4 files: data.csv, data.json, data_cleaned.csv and data_text.json, are the output files generated.

For getting the output,
Go to the folder in which you have cloned this repo.

Type the following command: 

<b><code> scrapy crawl jokes -o outputfile.csv </code></b>


<b>Explanation</b>: scrapy crawl will run jokes.py which is a spider (file in the jokes_scrapy/demo_project/spiders/jokes.py)
              and saves the output in the outputfile.csv. (You can also save the output in outputfile.json)
